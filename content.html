        <h1>Cybersecurity Overview</h1>

        <h2>Key Points in Cybersecurity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)</strong>: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are the core principles of cybersecurity.</li>
            <li><strong>Types of Cyber Threats</strong>: Malware, Phishing, SQL Injection, Denial of Service, Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, and Zero-day Exploits are common threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Cybersecurity Measures and Solutions</strong>: Firewalls, Encryption, Two-Factor Authentication, IDS/IPS, Antivirus, and SIEM are key defense mechanisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Cybersecurity Frameworks and Standards</strong>: NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO/IEC 27001, GDPR Compliance, and PCI DSS are important standards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advantages of Cybersecurity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Protection: Protects sensitive information.</li>
            <li>Protection Against Cyber Attacks: Defends against malware, phishing, and other threats.</li>
            <li>Reduced Financial Losses: Prevents costly damages and legal fees.</li>
            <li>Improved Customer Confidence: Enhances trust by safeguarding customer data.</li>
            <li>Compliance with Regulations: Helps meet data protection laws.</li>
            <li>Operational Continuity: Ensures system uptime and minimizes disruptions.</li>
            <li>Reputation Management: Prevents negative publicity from breaches.</li>
            <li>Innovation and Competitiveness: Secures adoption of new technologies and maintains a competitive edge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Emerging Trends in Cybersecurity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>AI and Machine Learning: Used for real-time threat detection.</li>
            <li>Zero Trust Architecture: No entity inside or outside the network is trusted by default.</li>
            <li>Cloud Security: Protecting data and apps hosted in cloud environments.</li>
            <li>IoT Security: Securing interconnected smart devices.</li>
            <li>Quantum Cryptography: Provides next-level encryption to resist quantum computing attacks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges in Cybersecurity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sophistication of Cyber Attacks: Attacks are becoming more advanced and harder to detect.</li>
            <li>Lack of Skilled Professionals: There's a growing shortage of cybersecurity experts.</li>
            <li>Insider Threats: Employees or partners may accidentally or intentionally compromise security.</li>
            <li>Evolving Regulations: Constant changes in laws around data protection.</li>
            <li>Cost of Implementation: High costs may be a barrier for smaller organizations.</li>
        </ul>
